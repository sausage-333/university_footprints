# Data Structures and Algorithm for Electrical Engineering

This is the 4 **C++ projects** performed in the course *Data Structures and Algorithm for Electrical Engineering* in the fall semester of 2018. Following is the brief summary of each project. Please check the details in the each folder.

1. Student Management System.
- This project was assigned to get used to **C++ grammar** and the main functions which do not exist in C such as **function overloading or object oriented programming**.

2. Receiving Messages from a Packet Network
- The main purpose of this project is to **implement singly linked list and doubly linked list, and compare the performance of these two lists**. Also, the **concept of the iterator** is significant in this project. In addition, reconstructing and sorting strings were minor issues.   

3. Search and Replace in a Large Text File
- The main purpose of this project is to **implement AVL Tree and RB Tree, and compare the performance of these two trees**. Also, **the concept of deep copy** is included. In addition, sorting and spliting string issues were included.

4. Graph Structure and Algorithm
- The main purpose of this project is to **implement abstract data type Graph using adjacency list structure**. And also, **solving shortest path problem(Dijkstra's algorithm) and minimum spanning tree problem(Kruskal's algorithm)** are included. Please check the task2 file.
