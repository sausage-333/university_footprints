# university_footprints

Hello, I am Kang-wook Jang. Nice to see you! I am senior in my university, KAIST, and majoring electrical engineering. Also minoring mathmatics & intellectual properties. I am planning to go on to graduate school in KAIST next year, 2020.

These folders are my university footprints that I have accumulated since my junior year(2017) at university. It mainly contains footprints about developing something by coding. The programming language contains C, C++, Python, Matlab. I usually use python with jupyter notebook.

Following is the brief explanation of each courses.

1. Introduction to Electronics Design Lab.
- This course is a experiment course for electrical engineering students. I made postfix calculator by C.

2. Programming Structures for Electrical Engineering
- Basic courses for getting used to coding. However, the load was very heavy and hard for coding starters like me. There is a simple unix shell that I built.

3. Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineering
- Studies various data Structures and algorithms, such as linked list, AVL trees, graphs, Dijkstra's algorithms etc. Please check the folder inside to get more details.

4. Digital Signal Processing
- Folder contains the digital filter with given frequency constraints. Impulse invariance method, Bilinear transformation method and more are introduced.

5. EE Co-op Internship
- I had an internship at Naver in 2018. There is no code left for the internship, but you can check my presentations that I used for the mid-term & final-term presentations.

6. Individual Studies
- I had done lab internship at Statistical Speech and Sound Computing Lab in KAIST from September 2018 to Febuary 2019. Please check what I'd done inside the folder!

7. Digital Speech Processing
- I learned several speech processing techniques in this course. You can check how can I determine pitch frequency of the voice.

8. Introduction to Numerical Analysis
- I studied several numerical techniques for solving problems such as solving equation or getting eigenvalue. Several techniques are written in Matlab code.

9. Matrix Computation and Application
- There is several techniques for decomposing matrix into right forms. There are 10 topics of assignments, so get into the folder to check it!
