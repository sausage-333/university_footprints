# Unix Shell

### Readme

This is the last assignment of the course Programming Structures for Electrical Engineering. During the whole spring semester in 2017, I had done total 6 programming assignments **written in C** and this is the hardest one which is a task about building a Unix Shell.

Following text is the brief of the assignment. I omitted the detail requirements of it. If you want to refer the detail, you can check the link below.

Even though this is the 2019 version assignment, it doesn't change much so far. Also, you can check the other assignments except 5th one. It was eliminated due to the heavy load of the course in 2018 and was about dynamic memory management.

### Purpose

The  purpose of this assignment is to help you learn about Unix processes, low-level input/output, and signals. It will also give you ample opportunity to define software modules; in that sense the assignment is a capstone for the course.

### Background

A Unix shell is a program that makes the facilities of the operating system available to interactive users. There are several popular Unix shells: sh (the Bourne shell), csh (the C shell), and bash (the Bourne Again shell) are a few.

### Your Task

Your task in this assignment is to create a program named **ish**. Your program should be a minimal but realistic interactive Unix shell.
