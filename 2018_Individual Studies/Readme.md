# Individual Studies

I have done individual studies in the **Statistical Speech & Sound Computing Lab** in fall and winter semester of 2018. Followings are the contents of the presentation. Please check the details in the ppt file written in Korean.

1. Machine Learning Study
- I studied machine learning with the Andrew Ng's coursera lecture.

- In the presentation, contents are including supervised learning/unsupervised learning, linear/logistic regression, regularization, neural network.

- In the winter semester, I had learned until just before support vector machine(SVM).

2. Auto Speech Recognition(ASR) Study
- I studied auto speech recognition briefly with the lecture from the university of Edinburgh.

- The contents include MFCC Framework, Probability Model, Hidden Markov Model.

3. Audio Super Resolution
- I had planned undergraduate research program with the topic of audio super resolution, but it didn't selected by my department. Following git was the leading thesis contents of my research.

4. Python-Matlab Conversion
- I made matlab GUI, and this GUI is called back from the python code. Nothing special, so I didn't uploaded the code.

5. Tensorflow Practice code
- I had studied deep learning with the book **골빈해커의 3분 딥러닝** by 김진중 until chapter 5. There is my toy codes inside to folder.

- I also watched the lecture **모두를 위한 딥러닝** by 김성훈.
