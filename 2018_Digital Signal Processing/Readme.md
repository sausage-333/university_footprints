# Digital Signal Processing

This is the final term project for the course *Digital Signal Processing* in the fall semester of 2018. The project is about making digital filter in the given stop-band & pass-band constraints **with matlab**. Following is the contents of the project.

1. Type II Chebyshev low-pass filter is designed with impulse invariance and bilinear transformation methods respectively.

2. Transforming Type II Chebyshev low-pass filter to high-pass filter using frequency transformation method.

3. Designing a linear phase finite impulse response low-pass filter using rectangular window and hamming window respectively.

Please check the details in my report. It's written in Korean.
