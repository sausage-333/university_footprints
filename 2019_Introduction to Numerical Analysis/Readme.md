# Introduction to Numerical Analysis

This folder has contents of coding assignments from the lecture *Introduction to Numerical Analysis* which was held in the spring semester of 2019. Codes and comments are written in **Matlab**, and following is the contents of the assignments.

1. Secant & Newton Method

2. Hornor & Muller Method

3. Lagrange & Hermite Polynomial

4. Runge-Kuttta Method

5. LDL & Cholesky Decomposition

6. Eigenvalue & Least Mean Square Problems

*There were total 8 assignments, but only 6 of them had coding assignments.*
